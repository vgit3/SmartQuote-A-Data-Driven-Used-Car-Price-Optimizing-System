Optimum Quotation Price Analysis for Used Cars
1. Introduction
The objective of this project is to analyze used car pricing trends and develop a predictive model to determine the optimal quotation price.
This study helps in understanding the key factors that influence car prices and provides insights for buyers, sellers, and businesses dealing in used cars.
The car price prediction analysis in the code can be highly useful for a car company in multiple ways, particularly for used car dealerships, manufacturers, and pricing strategists.
 > Helps the company set competitive prices for used cars based on key factors like model, mileage, engine size, and year.
 > Avoids overpricing (which may reduce sales) and underpricing (which may reduce profit margins).
 > Identifies which features impact price the most (e.g., newer models, lower mileage, or automatic transmission).
 > Helps dealerships decide which cars to stock more based on historical pricing trends.
 > Identifies slow-moving models that may need discounts or promotions.
 > Customer Trust & Transparency: Helps justify pricing by providing a data-driven price estimate to customers.
                                  Reduces price negotiation issues, leading to faster sales and improved customer satisfaction

Project Description:

3. Data Collection and Preprocessing
Dataset: The dataset was sourced from a CSV file (used_car_price_analysis.csv).
Missing Values: Identified and replaced missing values with the column mean.
Duplicate Removal: Removed duplicate records to ensure data integrity.
Encoding Categorical Variables:
Transmission Type: Converted from categorical to numerical values using Label Encoding.
Fuel Type: Replaced with the frequency count of each type.
Car Model: Replaced with the average price of that model using Target Mean Encoding.

4. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Correlation Analysis: Identified the top 5 features most correlated with price:
year, engineSize, mileage, tax, and model.
Visualizations:
Boxplot: Showed price distribution by transmission type.
Regression Plot: Examined the relationship between MPG (Miles Per Gallon) and price.

5. Machine Learning Models
A. Single Variable Linear Regression
Feature Used: engineSize
Performance Metrics:
R² Score: Measures how well the model explains price variations.
Mean Squared Error (MSE): Evaluates the prediction error.
B. Multiple Linear Regression
Features Used: model, year, mileage, tax, engineSize
Performance Metrics:
R² and MSE were calculated to determine the effectiveness of the model.

6. Results & Findings
Year, engine size, and mileage significantly impact used car prices.
Automatic transmission cars tend to have higher prices than manual ones.
Higher engine sizes correlate with higher prices.
Multiple regression performed better than single-variable regression due to more features being included.

7. Conclusion & Recommendations
A data-driven approach can help optimize used car pricing.
More features like brand reputation and vehicle condition can further improve predictions.
Future work can explore non-linear models (e.g., Random Forest, Gradient Boosting) for improved accuracy.
